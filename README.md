# DDoS Protection System
Team Members: Geetanshaüê∏ , Ritiküê∑

A comprehensive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection system implemented as a college project, featuring multiple layers of security including machine learning-based threat detection, rate limiting, CAPTCHA verification, IP blocking, and intelligent firewall mechanisms.

## üõ°Ô∏è Project Overview

This project implements a multi-layered defense system against DDoS attacks using modern cybersecurity techniques and machine learning algorithms. The system is designed to detect, mitigate, and prevent various types of DDoS attacks while maintaining legitimate user access to web services.

### üéØ Objectives
- **Real-time DDoS Detection** - Identify attack patterns using ML algorithms
- **Automated Mitigation** - Implement immediate response mechanisms
- **Multi-layer Protection** - Deploy various defense strategies simultaneously
- **Legitimate Traffic Preservation** - Ensure minimal impact on genuine users
- **Scalable Architecture** - Handle high-volume traffic scenarios

## üîê Security Features

### 1. **Machine Learning Firewall**
- **Anomaly Detection** - Identifies unusual traffic patterns
- **Behavioral Analysis** - Learns normal vs. malicious traffic behavior
- **Real-time Classification** - Instant threat assessment
- **Adaptive Learning** - Continuous model improvement

### 2. **Rate Limiting**
- **Request Throttling** - Limits requests per IP per time window
- **Sliding Window Algorithm** - Smooth rate control implementation
- **Configurable Thresholds** - Adjustable limits based on traffic patterns
- **Burst Protection** - Handles sudden traffic spikes

### 3. **CAPTCHA Verification**
- **Suspicious Traffic Challenge** - Human verification for questionable requests
- **Progressive Difficulty** - Escalating challenges for repeated violations
- **Image/Text Recognition** - Multiple CAPTCHA types
- **Bot Detection Integration** - Triggers based on bot scores

### 4. **Intelligent IP Blocking**
- **Dynamic Blacklisting** - Automatic IP blocking based on behavior
- **Whitelist Management** - Protected IP ranges for trusted sources
- **Geolocation Filtering** - Country/region-based blocking
- **Temporary vs. Permanent Blocks** - Flexible blocking duration

### 5. **Bad Bot Detection**
- **User-Agent Analysis** - Identifies malicious crawlers and bots
- **Behavioral Fingerprinting** - Detects automated behavior patterns
- **Honeypot Integration** - Trap mechanisms for bot identification
- **Browser Fingerprinting** - Device and browser characteristic analysis
